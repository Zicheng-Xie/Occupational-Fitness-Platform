## Established rule findings

No rule criteria were established from the available verified facts. This does not establish absence of disease or failure of retrieval.


## Information coverage

- blackout: No source-supported facts for this requested module; some facts require confirmation; 0 supported fields; 2 unresolved rule fields.

## Retrieval activity

Rule-scoped ranking calls: 8.
Symptom discovery searches: 1.
Zero triggered rules does not mean retrieval failed. Retrieved text is not a diagnosis.

### blackout symptom retrieval

> The driver explicitly denies any lifetime blackout, loss of consciousness or episode of impaired awareness, and the current nurse history confirms no blackout history; a sister's faint after standing in a hot room is recorded as family information, while the driver's own tiredness after an overnight route occurred with preserved awareness and no witness-reported unresponsiveness, rather than a confirmed episode being denied or reclassified after the fact.

## Extraction semantic review

Extraction semantic review: Possible extraction issues require confirmation
This second-pass model review does not establish clinical accuracy. A clinician must verify the original record and any flagged information.
Confirm blackout.mechanism_status (omission): Independent source reading differs from the extraction. The driver explicitly denies any lifetime blackout, loss of consciousness or episode of impaired awareness, and the current nurse history confirms no blackout history.
Fields withheld from rule inputs: blackout.mechanism_status

### blackout.mechanism_status — omission

Independent source reading differs from the extraction. The driver explicitly denies any lifetime blackout, loss of consciousness or episode of impaired awareness, and the current nurse history confirms no blackout history.

## Case source

```text
Synthetic nurse note for software testing. No real patient data.

The nurse reviews a commercial driver's symptoms alongside information from a witness, the treating team and an older workplace form, because each source describes a different part of the story; the occupational record retains those differences and identifies completed current findings without turning a booking, a family account or a recollection into a measured patient result.

The driver explicitly denies any lifetime blackout, loss of consciousness or episode of impaired awareness, and the current nurse history confirms no blackout history; a sister's faint after standing in a hot room is recorded as family information, while the driver's own tiredness after an overnight route occurred with preserved awareness and no witness-reported unresponsiveness, rather than a confirmed episode being denied or reclassified after the fact.

The driver alternates urban deliveries with a longer motorway leg and describes a busy depot where engine noise, glare and interrupted meals can complicate an account of symptoms; the nurse records the work setting as context, while keeping the dated clinical findings distinct from the driver's explanation for why a symptom might have occurred on that shift.

The nurse reads the summary back to the driver to check the chronology and separates agreement about the wording from verification of a medical finding, then attaches the identified clinical material; any decision about further investigation or work allocation remains for the reviewing professional, and the note itself does not certify that all relevant clinical questions have been answered.

## Established rule findings

No rule criteria were established from the available verified facts. This does not establish absence of disease or failure of retrieval.


## Information coverage

- hypertension: No source-supported facts for this requested module; 0 supported fields; 2 unresolved rule fields.

## Retrieval activity

Rule-scoped ranking calls: 3.
Symptom discovery searches: 1.
Zero triggered rules does not mean retrieval failed. Retrieved text is not a diagnosis.

## Clinician checklist

- [ ] Clinician: review source facts, rule applicability and every provisional conclusion.
- [ ] Confirm the commercial driving task and assess conditions outside the five-module scope.
- [ ] Confirm missing/unverified case fact: cardiovascular.blood_pressure.persistent_diastolic
- [ ] Confirm missing/unverified case fact: cardiovascular.blood_pressure.persistent_systolic

## Case source

```text
Synthetic nurse note for software testing. No real patient data.

At a scheduled commercial-driver medical, the driver answers questions in several stages because a dispatcher keeps calling about the next route, while the nurse checks a current clinical document against a copied workplace summary; an observation described confidently in conversation is kept separate from a finding actually recorded in an identified examination.

A cropped phone photograph displays 174/104 mmHg without a patient identifier or date, whereas today's single observed blood pressure is 146/88 mmHg after rest; the driver says the photograph may have been taken before he restarted tablets, the home monitor has not been checked, and the nurse has no repeated current measurements from which to establish persistent systolic or diastolic pressure.

Part of the usual route requires reversing near workers and reading changing signs before entering a customer site, although today's assessment takes place in a quiet room; the driver is asked to describe the sequence and timing of difficulties, and the note preserves the difference between an occupational concern, a suspected mechanism and a completed clinical assessment.

The nurse keeps the relevant current attachment with the record and identifies the older account by its timing, so a later reviewer can distinguish what was observed, what the driver reported and what remains unresolved; no additional measurement, specialist conclusion or diagnosis is added merely because it would make the occupational decision easier to complete.

## Established rule findings

No rule criteria were established from the available verified facts. This does not establish absence of disease or failure of retrieval.


## Information coverage

- hypertension: No source-supported facts for this requested module; 0 supported fields; 2 unresolved rule fields.

## Retrieval activity

Rule-scoped ranking calls: 3.
Symptom discovery searches: 1.
Zero triggered rules does not mean retrieval failed. Retrieved text is not a diagnosis.

## Clinician checklist

- [ ] Clinician: review source facts, rule applicability and every provisional conclusion.
- [ ] Confirm the commercial driving task and assess conditions outside the five-module scope.
- [ ] Confirm missing/unverified case fact: cardiovascular.blood_pressure.persistent_diastolic
- [ ] Confirm missing/unverified case fact: cardiovascular.blood_pressure.persistent_systolic

## Case source

```text
Synthetic nurse note for software testing. No real patient data.

In a commercial-driver follow-up arranged after an occupational screening concern, the nurse interviews the driver and checks the accompanying documents against the reported sequence of events; the employer wants a quick answer before allocating a vehicle, but the record separates present evidence, historical findings and questions that the clinician has not yet resolved.

A cropped phone photograph displays 188/108 mmHg without a patient identifier or date, whereas today's single observed blood pressure is 146/88 mmHg after rest; the driver says the photograph may have been taken before he restarted tablets, the home monitor has not been checked, and the nurse has no repeated current measurements from which to establish persistent systolic or diastolic pressure.

The employer's copied form relates to an earlier period of work and contains a broad satisfactory box without the measurements underlying it, whereas the current nurse entry identifies the source of each specific finding; the driver's wish to continue scheduled duties is recorded as a preference, not as proof that the present assessment has resolved the documented concern.

Before closing the interview, the nurse checks that the driver's recollection and the supplied clinical document have not been merged into a single undated finding, and records the outstanding documents separately; the completed entries remain current findings, while any missing qualification, conflicting detail or unperformed examination stays available for review rather than being silently treated as normal.

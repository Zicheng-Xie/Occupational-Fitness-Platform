## Established rule findings

No rule criteria were established from the available verified facts. This does not establish absence of disease or failure of retrieval.


## Information coverage

- hearing: No source-supported facts for this requested module; some facts require confirmation; 0 supported fields; 3 unresolved rule fields.

## Retrieval activity

Rule-scoped ranking calls: 5.
Symptom discovery searches: 1.
Zero triggered rules does not mean retrieval failed. Retrieved text is not a diagnosis.

### hearing symptom retrieval

> The audiologist reports an unaided better-ear average of 55 dB over 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 kHz and confirms that the hearing standard is not met with the currently fitted aid; the driver says speech is louder but less clear when the reversing alarm sounds, and the completed specialist letter recommends further individual assessment without supplying a practical driver assessment result or a finding that the present equipment resolves the functional difficulty.

## Extraction semantic review

Extraction semantic review: Possible extraction issues require confirmation
This second-pass model review does not establish clinical accuracy. A clinician must verify the original record and any flagged information.
Confirm hearing.audiometry.available (omission): Independent source reading differs from the extraction. A formal audiogram is available.
Confirm hearing.clinical_assessment (omission): Independent source reading differs from the extraction. A screening impression of possible hearing_loss is a documented classification possible_hearing_loss, not confirmation of a measured hearing threshold.
Fields withheld from rule inputs: hearing.audiometry.available, hearing.clinical_assessment

### hearing.audiometry.available — omission

## Case source

```text
Synthetic nurse note for software testing. No real patient data.

During a commercial-driver review after a refrigerated-freight run, the nurse brings together the driver's account, a dated clinical attachment and an employer form copied from an earlier assessment; the documents refer to different times, and the current entry distinguishes a completed examination from recollections, plans and information concerning another person.

The audiologist reports an unaided better-ear average of 55 dB over 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 kHz and confirms that the hearing standard is not met with the currently fitted aid; the driver says speech is louder but less clear when the reversing alarm sounds, and the completed specialist letter recommends further individual assessment without supplying a practical driver assessment result or a finding that the present equipment resolves the functional difficulty.

The interview takes place before the driver's next planned roster, and the nurse records changes in symptoms, treatment and available documents without assuming that a future specialist appointment has already occurred; any letter that has been requested but not supplied remains separate from the findings actually available when this occupational record is written.

The nurse reads the summary back to the driver to check the chronology and separates agreement about the wording from verification of a medical finding, then attaches the identified clinical material; any decision about further investigation or work allocation remains for the reviewing professional, and the note itself does not certify that all relevant clinical questions have been answered.

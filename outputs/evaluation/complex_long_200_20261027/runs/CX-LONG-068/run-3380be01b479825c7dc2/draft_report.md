## Established rule findings

1 rules triggered from source-supported facts. The overall assessment is incomplete; this does not erase the findings below. Missing facts in any requested module can prevent an overall clearance.

- hypertension: `HTN-COM-UNCONDITIONAL-001` - Persistent blood pressure exceeds the commercial unconditional-licence threshold.

## Information coverage

- hypertension: Source-supported facts available; some facts require confirmation; 3 supported fields; 5 unresolved rule fields.

## Retrieval activity

Rule-scoped ranking calls: 2.
Symptom discovery searches: 1.
Zero triggered rules does not mean retrieval failed. Retrieved text is not a diagnosis.

> The driver restarted antihypertensive tablets twelve days ago after a period of missed doses, and the current clinic letter still records persistent BP 182/106 mmHg on repeat checks; a four-week follow-up period has not yet been completed, the driver brings a booking confirmation rather than a specialist opinion, and occasional improvement on a home display cannot establish sustained control or the absence of relevant treatment problems.

Extraction semantic review: Possible extraction issues require confirmation
This second-pass model review does not establish clinical accuracy. A clinician must verify the original record and any flagged information.
Confirm cardiovascular.blood_pressure.observed_diastolic (unsupported): Independent source reading differs from the extraction. The patient fact is not documented in the provided source passages.

## Case source

```text
Synthetic nurse note for software testing. No real patient data.

The nurse reviews a commercial driver's symptoms alongside information from a witness, the treating team and an older workplace form, because each source describes a different part of the story; the occupational record retains those differences and identifies completed current findings without turning a booking, a family account or a recollection into a measured patient result.

The driver restarted antihypertensive tablets twelve days ago after a period of missed doses, and the current clinic letter still records persistent BP 182/106 mmHg on repeat checks; a four-week follow-up period has not yet been completed, the driver brings a booking confirmation rather than a specialist opinion, and occasional improvement on a home display cannot establish sustained control or the absence of relevant treatment problems.

The employer's copied form relates to an earlier period of work and contains a broad satisfactory box without the measurements underlying it, whereas the current nurse entry identifies the source of each specific finding; the driver's wish to continue scheduled duties is recorded as a preference, not as proof that the present assessment has resolved the documented concern.

Before closing the interview, the nurse checks that the driver's recollection and the supplied clinical document have not been merged into a single undated finding, and records the outstanding documents separately; the completed entries remain current findings, while any missing qualification, conflicting detail or unperformed examination stays available for review rather than being silently treated as normal.

## Established rule findings

No rule criteria were established from the available verified facts. This does not establish absence of disease or failure of retrieval.


## Information coverage

- hearing: No source-supported facts for this requested module; some facts require confirmation; 0 supported fields; 3 unresolved rule fields.

## Retrieval activity

Rule-scoped ranking calls: 5.
Symptom discovery searches: 1.
Zero triggered rules does not mean retrieval failed. Retrieved text is not a diagnosis.

### hearing symptom retrieval

> The audiologist's current signed report documents an unaided better-ear average of 38 dB over 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 kHz, with no aid worn during the measurements and audiometry explicitly completed; the driver sometimes turns the volume up for traffic updates in a noisy loading area, but the nurse separates that environmental complaint from the identified ear, frequencies and unaided testing conditions in the report.

## Extraction semantic review

Extraction semantic review: Possible extraction issues require confirmation
This second-pass model review does not establish clinical accuracy. A clinician must verify the original record and any flagged information.
Confirm hearing.audiometry.available (omission): Independent source reading differs from the extraction. A formal audiogram is available.
Confirm hearing.clinical_assessment (omission): Independent source reading differs from the extraction. A screening impression of possible hearing_loss is a documented classification possible_hearing_loss, not confirmation of a measured hearing threshold.
Fields withheld from rule inputs: hearing.audiometry.available, hearing.clinical_assessment

### hearing.audiometry.available — omission

## Case source

```text
Synthetic nurse note for software testing. No real patient data.

The commercial driver attends after a long shift with a folder containing a current signed letter, older screening paperwork and a handwritten personal account, and the nurse reconstructs the chronology before recording the present findings; differences between the records are described explicitly rather than resolved by treating the newest-looking photocopy as automatically authoritative.

The audiologist's current signed report documents an unaided better-ear average of 38 dB over 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 kHz, with no aid worn during the measurements and audiometry explicitly completed; the driver sometimes turns the volume up for traffic updates in a noisy loading area, but the nurse separates that environmental complaint from the identified ear, frequencies and unaided testing conditions in the report.

The employer's copied form relates to an earlier period of work and contains a broad satisfactory box without the measurements underlying it, whereas the current nurse entry identifies the source of each specific finding; the driver's wish to continue scheduled duties is recorded as a preference, not as proof that the present assessment has resolved the documented concern.

The nurse reads the summary back to the driver to check the chronology and separates agreement about the wording from verification of a medical finding, then attaches the identified clinical material; any decision about further investigation or work allocation remains for the reviewing professional, and the note itself does not certify that all relevant clinical questions have been answered.

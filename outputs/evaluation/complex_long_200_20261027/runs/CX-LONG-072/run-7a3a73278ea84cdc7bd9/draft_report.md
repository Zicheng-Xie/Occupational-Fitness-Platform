## Established rule findings

No rule criteria were established from the available verified facts. This does not establish absence of disease or failure of retrieval.


## Information coverage

- hearing: Source-supported facts available; some facts require confirmation; 1 supported fields; 3 unresolved rule fields.

## Retrieval activity

Rule-scoped ranking calls: 5.
Symptom discovery searches: 1.
Zero triggered rules does not mean retrieval failed. Retrieved text is not a diagnosis.

### hearing symptom retrieval

> The current nurse assessment records possible hearing loss after the driver repeatedly asks for spoken instructions to be repeated, while the driver explains that he can hear a television at home and an older employer form called his hearing satisfactory; audiometry has not been performed, the ENT appointment is booked rather than completed, and no quantified unaided threshold or qualified aided assessment is available to resolve the disagreement.

## Extraction semantic review

Extraction semantic review: Possible extraction issues require confirmation
This second-pass model review does not establish clinical accuracy. A clinician must verify the original record and any flagged information.
Confirm hearing.clinical_assessment (omission): Independent source reading differs from the extraction. A screening impression of possible hearing loss is a documented classification possible_hearing_loss, not confirmation of a measured hearing threshold.
Fields withheld from rule inputs: hearing.clinical_assessment

### hearing.clinical_assessment — omission

Independent source reading differs from the extraction. A screening impression of possible hearing loss is a documented classification possible_hearing_loss, not confirmation of a measured hearing threshold.

## Case source

```text
Synthetic nurse note for software testing. No real patient data.

During a commercial-driver review after a refrigerated-freight run, the nurse brings together the driver's account, a dated clinical attachment and an employer form copied from an earlier assessment; the documents refer to different times, and the current entry distinguishes a completed examination from recollections, plans and information concerning another person.

The current nurse assessment records possible hearing loss after the driver repeatedly asks for spoken instructions to be repeated, while the driver explains that he can hear a television at home and an older employer form called his hearing satisfactory; audiometry has not been performed, the ENT appointment is booked rather than completed, and no quantified unaided threshold or qualified aided assessment is available to resolve the disagreement.

The interview takes place before the driver's next planned roster, and the nurse records changes in symptoms, treatment and available documents without assuming that a future specialist appointment has already occurred; any letter that has been requested but not supplied remains separate from the findings actually available when this occupational record is written.

The nurse keeps the relevant current attachment with the record and identifies the older account by its timing, so a later reviewer can distinguish what was observed, what the driver reported and what remains unresolved; no additional measurement, specialist conclusion or diagnosis is added merely because it would make the occupational decision easier to complete.

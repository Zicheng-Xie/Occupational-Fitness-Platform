## Unverified local-model commentary

This synthetic validation fixture presents a commercial driver assessment with a diagnosed blackout due to hypoglycaemia. The patient's blood pressure is within the unconditional standard, and their vision and hearing assessments meet the standard. However, the blackout diagnosis requires further assessment under the diabetes chapter to determine the cause. A clinician must review this case to determine the next steps.

## Unverified local-model commentary

This commercial driver assessment is for a synthetic validation fixture, not a real patient. The driver has insulin-treated diabetes with a severe hypoglycaemic event two weeks ago. The assessment outcome is temporarily unfit due to the recent severe hypoglycaemic event. The driver's blood pressure is within the normal range, and their vision and hearing are normal. However, the driver's diabetes regimen minimises hypoglycaemia, and they have glucose monitoring records for three months. The driver's specialist information is available, and they have a recent severe hypoglycaemic event. The driver's treatment category is insulin, and they have a history of severe hypoglycaemic events. The driver's driving relevant end-organ effects are false, and they are not fit to hold an unconditional licence according to the evidence.

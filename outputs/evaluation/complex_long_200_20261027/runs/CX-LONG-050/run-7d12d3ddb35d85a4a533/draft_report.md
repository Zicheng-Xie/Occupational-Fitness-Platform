## Established rule findings

No rule criteria were established from the available verified facts. This does not establish absence of disease or failure of retrieval.


## Information coverage

- blackout: No source-supported facts for this requested module; 0 supported fields; 2 unresolved rule fields.

## Retrieval activity

Rule-scoped ranking calls: 8.
Symptom discovery searches: 1.
Zero triggered rules does not mean retrieval failed. Retrieved text is not a diagnosis.

### blackout symptom retrieval

> The driver recalls a short gap in a radio conversation while seated after unloading, but a colleague says he remained responsive and might simply have been distracted by paperwork; the nurse cannot confirm loss of consciousness or a blackout from the conflicting accounts, a pulse reading taken later does not resolve awareness during the episode, and the physician has requested further history rather than diagnosing a specific cause.

## Clinician checklist

- [ ] Clinician: review source facts, rule applicability and every provisional conclusion.
- [ ] Confirm the commercial driving task and assess conditions outside the five-module scope.
- [ ] Confirm missing/unverified case fact: blackout.mechanism_status
- [ ] Confirm missing/unverified case fact: blackout.occurred
- [ ] unavailable_or_invalid
- [ ] Extraction semantic review: Not completed (model unavailable or response invalid)
- [ ] This second-pass model review does not establish clinical accuracy. A clinician must verify the original record and any flagged information.

## Case source

```text
Synthetic nurse note for software testing. No real patient data.

The commercial driver attends after a long shift with a folder containing a current signed letter, older screening paperwork and a handwritten personal account, and the nurse reconstructs the chronology before recording the present findings; differences between the records are described explicitly rather than resolved by treating the newest-looking photocopy as automatically authoritative.

The driver recalls a short gap in a radio conversation while seated after unloading, but a colleague says he remained responsive and might simply have been distracted by paperwork; the nurse cannot confirm loss of consciousness or a blackout from the conflicting accounts, a pulse reading taken later does not resolve awareness during the episode, and the physician has requested further history rather than diagnosing a specific cause.

The usual work involves coupling trailers, checking mirrors, interpreting radio messages and responding to pedestrians in a loading area, with breaks that can be delayed when deliveries run late; the driver explains which difficulty occurred while stationary and which was noticed during ordinary duties, rather than claiming that quiet conversation in the clinic reproduces every task in the cab.

The record is prepared for the reviewing clinician with the sequence of events and the provenance of the available findings intact, because the employer summary and the driver's account answer different questions; a completed test is retained as such, but an unresolved detail is not filled in from a family member's history or from an earlier document with different testing conditions.

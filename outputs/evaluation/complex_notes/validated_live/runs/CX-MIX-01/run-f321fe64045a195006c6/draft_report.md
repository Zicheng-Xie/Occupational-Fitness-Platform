## Case source

```text
The driver has a history of diabetes and says Diabetes is treated with insulin, but after an overnight shift he became unresponsive for about half a minute and later could not recall the conversation; a coworker gave glucose before any measurement, so the subsequent 4.2 mmol/L reading cannot establish whether a low glucose level caused the spell or exclude a different mechanism.

The referral describes possible hypoglycaemia, cardiac syncope or a seizure without choosing a diagnosis; the driver reports a blackout but his recollection differs from the witness, a heart monitor has been ordered and the mechanism remains under investigation, with no confirmed specialist explanation or reliable recurrence risk assessment.

His insulin doses were recently changed and he is missing several days of glucose records; specialist diabetes review must address monitoring and possible hypoglycaemic impairment, while the loss-of-awareness history requires its own assessment instead of automatically being attributed to diabetes.

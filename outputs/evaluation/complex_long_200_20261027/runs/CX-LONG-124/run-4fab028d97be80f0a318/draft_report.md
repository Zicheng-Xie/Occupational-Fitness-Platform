## Established rule findings

No rule criteria were established from the available verified facts. This does not establish absence of disease or failure of retrieval.


## Information coverage

- hypertension: No source-supported facts for this requested module; 0 supported fields; 2 unresolved rule fields.

## Retrieval activity

Rule-scoped ranking calls: 3.
Symptom discovery searches: 1.
Zero triggered rules does not mean retrieval failed. Retrieved text is not a diagnosis.

## Clinician checklist

- [ ] Clinician: review source facts, rule applicability and every provisional conclusion.
- [ ] Confirm the commercial driving task and assess conditions outside the five-module scope.
- [ ] Confirm missing/unverified case fact: cardiovascular.blood_pressure.persistent_diastolic
- [ ] Confirm missing/unverified case fact: cardiovascular.blood_pressure.persistent_systolic

## Case source

```text
Synthetic nurse note for software testing. No real patient data.

During a commercial-driver review after a refrigerated-freight run, the nurse brings together the driver's account, a dated clinical attachment and an employer form copied from an earlier assessment; the documents refer to different times, and the current entry distinguishes a completed examination from recollections, plans and information concerning another person.

A cropped phone photograph displays 182/106 mmHg without a patient identifier or date, whereas today's single observed blood pressure is 146/88 mmHg after rest; the driver says the photograph may have been taken before he restarted tablets, the home monitor has not been checked, and the nurse has no repeated current measurements from which to establish persistent systolic or diastolic pressure.

Part of the usual route requires reversing near workers and reading changing signs before entering a customer site, although today's assessment takes place in a quiet room; the driver is asked to describe the sequence and timing of difficulties, and the note preserves the difference between an occupational concern, a suspected mechanism and a completed clinical assessment.

For the occupational reviewer, the nurse retains both the definite findings and the limitations of the available account, including the timing and testing conditions where they matter, rather than producing a single reassuring label; the driver is told which information is on file and which details still require confirmation, without replacing the recorded clinical evidence with an employer's preference.

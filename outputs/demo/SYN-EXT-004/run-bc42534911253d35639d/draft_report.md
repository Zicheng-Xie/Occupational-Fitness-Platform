## Rule-to-source trace

### BLK-COM-UNCERTAIN-UNCONDITIONAL-001 — triggered

The blackout remains of uncertain nature after investigation, so the unconditional commercial standard is not met.

- `blackout.mechanism_status` = undetermined_after_investigation (present)
  - Source lines 16–16; chars 632:694: blackout.mechanism_status = "undetermined_after_investigation"

## Unverified local-model commentary

This synthetic validation fixture presents a commercial driver assessment with a single uncertain blackout episode, 4.99 event-free years documented, and no history of diabetes. The patient meets unconditional standards for hypertension, vision, and hearing. However, the uncertain blackout episode triggers a review of the patient's fitness to hold an unconditional licence. The clinician must review the case note and evidence to determine the patient's suitability for a licence.

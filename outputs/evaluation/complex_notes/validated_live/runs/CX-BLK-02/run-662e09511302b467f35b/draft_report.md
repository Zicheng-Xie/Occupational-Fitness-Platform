## Clinician checklist

- [ ] Clinician: review source facts, rule applicability and every provisional conclusion.
- [ ] Confirm the commercial driving task and assess conditions outside the five-module scope.
- [ ] Confirm missing/unverified case fact: blackout.mechanism_status
- [ ] Confirm missing/unverified case fact: blackout.occurred
- [ ] blackout.occurred
- [ ] unavailable_or_invalid
- [ ] Extraction semantic review: Not completed (model unavailable or response invalid)
- [ ] This second-pass model review does not establish clinical accuracy. A clinician must verify the original record and any flagged information.

## Case source

```text
The initial form says No blackouts, but during further questioning the driver reports a blackout while queuing in the heat six weeks ago and describes a second collapse the following week; he recovered quickly, says someone suggested a faint, and has not been told by a treating clinician that either event was definitively vasovagal syncope.

He asks whether heat would count as a provoking factor, yet one episode apparently occurred indoors and the witness is unavailable; investigations have started but no final mechanism, specialist opinion or reliable long-term event-free interval is documented, and the two different dates must not be merged into a single event.

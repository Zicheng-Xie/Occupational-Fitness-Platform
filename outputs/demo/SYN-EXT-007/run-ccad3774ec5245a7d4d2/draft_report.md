## Rule-to-source trace

### BLK-COM-UNCERTAIN-UNCONDITIONAL-001 — triggered

The blackout remains of uncertain nature after investigation, so the unconditional commercial standard is not met.

- `blackout.mechanism_status` = undetermined_after_investigation (present)
  - Source lines 16–16; chars 689:751: blackout.mechanism_status = "undetermined_after_investigation"

## Unverified local-model commentary

This synthetic validation fixture presents a commercial driver assessment with recurrent uncertain blackouts, separated by at least 24 hours, and exactly ten event-free years with specialist information. The patient's hypertension meets the unconditional standard, and their vision and hearing assessments also meet the unconditional standard. The patient's blackout history is uncertain, but they have specialist information available. The clinician must review the commentary and consider the patient's overall fitness to hold a licence.
